6-Jun 24 05:33:09.163 [warn] Couldn't find $HOME environment variable while expanding "~/.tor"; defaulting to "".
6-Jun 24 05:33:09.164 [warn] Default DataDirectory is "~/.tor".  This expands to "/.tor", which is probably not what you want.  Using "/var/tor" instead
6-Jun 24 05:33:09.164 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

6-Jun 24 05:33:12.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6587, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
